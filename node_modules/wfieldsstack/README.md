Mixin adds fields rotation mechanism to your class. It's widespread problem to change the value of a field and then after some steps revert old value, no matter what it was. FieldsStack does it for you behind the scene. FieldsStack mixins methods fieldPush, fieldPop which allocate a map of stacks of fields and manage it to avoid any corruption. Use the module to keep it simple and don't repeat yourself.

### Try out
```
npm install
node sample/Sample.s
```
