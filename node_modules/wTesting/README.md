# wTesting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wandalen/wTesting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wandalen/wTesting)

Framework for convenient unit testing. Testing provides the intuitive interface, simple tests structure, asynchronous code handling mechanism, colorful report, verbosity control and more. Use the module to get free of routines which can be automated.

### Installation

To install :

```npm install -g wTesting```

### Usage

#### Description

Test suit is a set of test routines in one file, each test routine is a set of test features( cases ).
Test feature is a combination of code execution and validation of obtained results, that is aimed to check some aspect of the program.

For convenience, each test feature may have own description, it can be provided through `description` field.

To get access to functionality of test package from test routine user must use first provided argument.

#### Assertions

Assertions are routines that are used in test routine to validate results of code execution.

List of mostly used assertions:

* identical - checks if two arguments are equal;
* shouldBe - checks if result of provided expression is true;
* shouldThrowError - checks if code execution throws an error;
* mustNotThrowError - checks if code execution ends without error.

#### Launch options

* verbosity - level of detail of information in the output;
* routine - name of test routine to run, other routines are ignored.

#### How to run

Locally expects path to file that contains test suit:

```node path/to/suit```

Globally expects path to folder that contains many test suits( files ), but also can work with single suit:

```wtest path/to/folder/with/suits```

With options:

```node path/to/suit verbosity : 5 routine : myTest```

### Example

```javascript
function myTest( test )
{  
  /* describe what is going to happen */
  test.description = 'info about test feature';

  /* do it and save results */
  var got = 'abc'.indexOf( 'a' );
  var expected = 0;

  /* compare result with expected */
  test.identical( got, expected );
}

/*
Map that describes test suit, contains
- name of the suit,
- map of test routines
- and other options
*/

var testSuite =
{
  name : 'name of my test suit',
  tests :
  {
      myTest : myTest
  }
}

/* Initilize test suit */
testSuite = wTestSuit( testSuite );

/* Run all tests of the suit */
wTools.Testing.test( testSuite );
